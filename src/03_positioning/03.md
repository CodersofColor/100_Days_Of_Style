## Intro
The position property specifies the type of positioning used for an element. There are five types of positioning.

## CSS Positioning
  - Static
    - HTML elements are positioned static by default.
    - Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
  - Relative
    - Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
  - Fixed
    - An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.
  - Absolute
    - An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
  - Sticky
    - An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
